# UdacityDeepLearning
Repository where I maintain my solutions to the Udacity Deep Learning course along with any additional things I choose to do as part of learning the material.

Current status:
Completed Assignment 6 Question 1, then decided to stop (though I may come back to this later). I realized that completing the final assignment is a lot of TensorFlow hacking that wouldn't be as useful to my learning (whenever I do need to implement a project, I'll do the hacking then). Also, I'm not as interested in this assignment as I was in previous ones and other work has begun picking up.


Final thoughts:
I think this Udacity course was very well done and gave me a good understanding of current techniques in Deep Learning, how to use TensorFlow and how to build neural networks. I hope to use this to implement cooler future projects!
